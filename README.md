# Facial Emotion Recognition

## 🔍 Overview
The **Facial Emotion Recognition** project aims to detect and classify human emotions based on facial expressions using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system processes real-time video or images to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 **Real-time Emotion Detection** – Detects emotions from a webcam feed.
- 🖼 **Image-based Analysis** – Analyzes emotions from static images.
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model** – Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification.
- 🖥 **User-friendly Interface** – Displays detected emotions in real-time.
- 📊 **Emotion Statistics** – Summarizes detected emotions over time.
- ⚡ **Fast and Efficient** – Optimized for real-time processing.

✅ Technologies Used
🐍 Programming Language: Python
📷 Computer Vision: OpenCV (for face detection and image processing)
🤖 Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (for emotion classification)
📊 Dataset: FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition Dataset)
💾 Machine Learning Framework: NumPy, Pandas (for data processing)
🖼 Image Processing: OpenCV, Matplotlib
⚡ Neural Networks: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
📈 Model Optimization: Dropout layers, Softmax activation function
🖥 IDE: Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda (used for development and testing)
